Two months ago, I tried growing cilantro at home because I thought I could save some money.
The plants came with a small nursery pot and I then did not know how soon the plants would not be producing leaves.
It was getting warmer early in May and I started growing cilantro again.
I bought cilantro, basil, rosemary, and mint from a local Homedepot and transplanted them to planters.
